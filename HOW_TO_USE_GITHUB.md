## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is like Google Drive, but specifically designed for organizing project files. It keeps everything in one place and tracks changes over time.

**Why we're using it:**
- ✅ Keep all outreach materials organized in one place
- ✅ Everyone on the team can access the latest versions
- ✅ Track what changes were made and when
- ✅ Private repository = Only EDGE team members can see it
