**THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY VALUE:**

Eileen, your unique position teaching across three entrepreneurship-adjacent disciplines makes you ideal for amplifying NEST-FEST's reach:

1. **Marketing Classes**: Students see positioning, segmentation, and brand strategy in action
2. **Fashion Marketing**: Direct exposure to Fashion Incubator entrepreneurs and fashion business models

Many entrepreneurial ventures need ALL three perspectives - marketing to acquire customers, fashion/product development for unique offerings, and real estate decisions for physical presence.
