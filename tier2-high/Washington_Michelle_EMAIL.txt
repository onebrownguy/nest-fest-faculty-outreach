Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Fashion Design, Retail & Marketing Entrepreneurship

Dear Michelle,

I hope this message finds you well! As Instructional Coordinator for the ACC Fashion Incubator with your Nike and Polo Jeans background, you understand how fashion students transition from design to business - and NEST-FEST offers that exact bridge.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR FASHION STUDENTS:**

Your experience at Nike and Polo Jeans shows students the corporate path. NEST-FEST shows them the entrepreneurial path:

- **Direct-to-Consumer Brands:** Fashion designers building their own brands without retail partnerships
- **Retail Strategy:** Pop-ups, online stores, wholesale vs. DTC decisions
- **Marketing & Branding:** Social media, influencer partnerships, brand storytelling for fashion startups
- **Product Development:** From concept to production to market launch
