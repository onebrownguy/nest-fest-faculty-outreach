Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Fashion Incubator Product Development & Sustainability Focus

Dear Michelle,

I hope this message finds you well! As Production Coordinator for the ACC Fashion Incubator with your expertise in apparel design and supply chain management, I wanted to reach out about NEST-FEST - an event that showcases sustainable business practices and product development strategies that Fashion Incubator students excel at.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR FASHION INCUBATOR:**

Your work focuses on production coordination and sustainable supply chain practices - exactly what emerging fashion businesses need:

- **Product Development:** Fashion Incubator students are creating products, not just designs
- **Sustainability Focus:** Ethical sourcing, sustainable materials, circular fashion models
- **Supply Chain Strategy:** Understanding manufacturing, production timelines, inventory management
- **Business Viability:** Turning creative designs into profitable, scalable businesses

NEST-FEST gives students a platform to pitch these complete business strategies, not just design concepts.
