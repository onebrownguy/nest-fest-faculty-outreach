Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Fashion Design Students Building Real Businesses

Dear Professor Chang,

I hope this message finds you well! As a Fashion Design professor at ACC, you're training students who could become the next generation of fashion entrepreneurs. NEST-FEST on November 7th provides a platform for fashion students to see - and participate in - the business side of fashion entrepreneurship.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY FASHION DESIGN STUDENTS SHOULD ATTEND:**

Fashion Incubator students are already building real businesses at ACC. NEST-FEST gives them (and your design students) a platform to pitch complete business strategies - not just design concepts, but product development, retail strategy, marketing plans, and financial projections.

**FASHION ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN ACTION:**
- Fashion designers building their own brands
- Direct-to-consumer vs. wholesale retail strategies
- Product development from concept to production
- Sustainable and ethical fashion business models
- Fashion Incubator success stories and best practices

**RETAIL & MARKETING STRATEGY:**
- Pop-up shops and retail partnership opportunities
- E-commerce platforms and online sales channels
- Instagram and social media for fashion brands
- Influencer collaborations and brand ambassadors
