Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Fashion Entrepreneurship + Business Operations for Your Students

Dear Professor Doolittle,

I hope this message finds you well! Your unique teaching portfolio spanning both Fashion Design and Office Administration & Technology creates a perfect intersection for NEST-FEST - where creative vision meets business operations.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOUR DUAL-DISCIPLINE STUDENTS:**

Your students span creative and operational skill sets - both essential for entrepreneurship:

**FASHION DESIGN STUDENTS:**
- Fashion Incubator entrepreneurs pitching fashion businesses
- Product development from concept to production
- Sustainable fashion and ethical business models
- Direct-to-consumer and wholesale retail strategies
- Fashion brand building and market positioning

**OFFICE ADMINISTRATION & TECHNOLOGY STUDENTS:**
- Business operations and administrative systems for startups
- Office technology tools for small business management
- Customer service and client relationship management
- Financial record-keeping and bookkeeping fundamentals
- Administrative support as entrepreneurial service opportunity

**QUICK OVERVIEW:**

üìç Presentation Hall, ACC Riverside Campus
‚è∞ **IDEA SUBMISSION DEADLINE: October 30, 2025**
üéì FREE for all ACC students
üèÜ Recognition and Awards for Top Pitches
üìä Creative vision + business operations

**INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT:**
This event is guided by:
- **Harshal Shah** - Program Director, Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy (harshal.shah@austincc.edu, 512-931-1791)
- **Dr. Andrea Kehoe** - Head of Product, Office of the Future
- **Dr. Monique Reeves** - Executive Director, Office of the Future
- **Monica Sack** - Co-Founder, Gather & Grow Experiences (Former SXSW content developer, 16 years)

**THE DUAL-ANGLE VALUE:**

Karla, every successful fashion entrepreneur needs both creative design AND operational excellence. Your students see different sides of the same entrepreneurial coin:

**Fashion Design Angle:**
- Turning creative concepts into marketable products
- Fashion Incubator connection and fashion entrepreneurship
- Branding, aesthetics, and product differentiation
- Understanding fashion industry business models

**Office Administration Angle:**
- Business systems and operations management
- Administrative support services as business opportunity
- Technology tools that enable small businesses
- Office management skills transferable to any venture

Many ACC students could benefit from BOTH perspectives - fashion students learning operational efficiency, and office admin students seeing creative entrepreneurship in action.
