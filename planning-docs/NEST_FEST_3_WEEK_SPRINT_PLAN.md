## 🎯 MANIFESTO: THE NEXT 23 DAYS

**This is not a normal event. This is a sprint.**

For the next 23 days, NEST-FEST is the top priority. Every email sent, every phone call made, every campus visit executed must drive toward one goal: **100+ students from all ACC campuses gathering on November 7 to celebrate entrepreneurship.**

**Success Looks Like:**
- Full Presentation Hall (standing room only)
- 15 incredible student pitches that inspire the audience
- 20+ VIP guests networking with students over appetizers
- Media coverage highlighting ACC's innovation ecosystem
- Students walking away thinking: "I can be an entrepreneur too."

**Failure Looks Like:**
- Empty seats on November 7
- Only 3-4 campuses represented
- VIP reception with 8 guests
- No media coverage
- "Just another campus event" that nobody remembers

**We Will Not Fail.**

This sprint plan is your roadmap. Execute it with intensity, adaptability, and relentless follow-through. When someone says "no," find another path. When registration stalls, double down on outreach. When tech fails, have backup plans.

On November 7 at 6:00 PM, when VIPs are mingling with pitch competition winners and students are buzzing about what they just experienced, you'll know it was all worth it.

**Let's make NEST-FEST 2025 legendary.** 🚀
