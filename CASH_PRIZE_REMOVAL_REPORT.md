## VERIFICATION RESULTS

### Remaining "Cash" References (All Legitimate)

Total legitimate accounting/finance references: **~50 references**

**Category: Financial Management Terms (LEGITIMATE)**
- "cash flow management" - Financial/accounting term
- "cash flow analysis" - Financial/accounting term
- "burn rate and cash flow" - Financial/accounting term
- "revenue projections, expense budgets, cash flow" - Financial context

**Examples from emails:**
- `Ahrenholtz_Courtney_EMAIL.txt`: "Burn rate, runway, and cash flow management for startups"
- `Stephens_Larry_EMAIL.txt`: "Every entrepreneur pitching must present financial projections, cash flow analysis"
- `Bishop_Okera_EMAIL.txt`: "Cash Flow Management: Burn rate, runway, break-even analysis"

These are appropriate academic/professional financial terms and should NOT be removed.

### Old File (Not Updated)
- `tier1-critical/Means_Nina_EMAIL_CORRECTED.txt` - Old corrected version, can be deleted

**Recommendation:** Delete old CORRECTED file or update it if needed for historical records.
