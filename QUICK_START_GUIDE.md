## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Should I send individually or use BCC mass email?**
A: Send individually for Tier 1 & 2 (personalization matters). Can use BCC for Tier 3 batches if time is limited.

**Q: What if they don't respond?**
A: Follow up once after 1 week. If still no response after 2nd attempt, move on. Some faculty are just busy.

**Q: Should I call or email?**
A: Email first for documentation. Offer call in email. Follow up with phone call for Tier 1 VIPs if no email response.

**Q: Can I modify the emails?**
A: Yes! These are templates. Add personal touches if you know the faculty member.

**Q: What's the success threshold?**
A: If 25+ faculty promote to students, that's a success. You'll reach 3,000+ students through their classes.
