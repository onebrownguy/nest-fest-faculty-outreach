Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Persuasive Communication & Pitch Presentation Masterclass

Dear Alexandra,

I hope this message finds you well! As Communication Studies faculty at ACC, you understand that communication skills determine entrepreneurial success. NEST-FEST on November 7th is a live demonstration of persuasive communication, storytelling, and pitch presentation techniques.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR COMMUNICATION STUDENTS:**

Your students study rhetoric, persuasion, and public speaking - NEST-FEST is where these skills create business success:

**COMMUNICATION IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**
- **Pitch Presentations:** 3-5 minute persuasive speeches that must convince audiences and investors
- **Storytelling:** How entrepreneurs use narrative structure to make ideas memorable
- **Audience Analysis:** Adapting messaging for different stakeholders (customers, investors, partners)
- **Nonverbal Communication:** Body language, vocal delivery, and visual aids in presentations
- **Persuasive Appeals:** Ethos (credibility), pathos (emotion), logos (logic) in business pitches

**The Reality:** The best idea loses without effective communication. The best pitch wins.
