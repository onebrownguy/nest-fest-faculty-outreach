Dear Jeff,

I hope this message finds you well! As Communication Studies faculty at ACC, you understand that strategic communication shapes how businesses are perceived and valued. NEST-FEST on November 7th showcases student entrepreneurs crafting brand narratives and communicating their vision.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy.
