Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Accounting Students See Financial Literacy in Action

Dear Professor Randolph,

I hope this message finds you well! As an Accounting professor at ACC, you teach students the financial fundamentals that every entrepreneur needs - budgeting, financial statements, cash flow management. NEST-FEST on November 7th showcases exactly why these accounting skills are essential for business success.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR ACCOUNTING STUDENTS:**

Your students learn accounting principles in the classroom - NEST-FEST shows them why those principles matter in the real world:

**ACCOUNTING IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**
- **Every pitch includes financials:** Revenue projections, expense budgets, cash flow management
- **Unit economics:** Cost per customer, profit margins, break-even analysis
- **Financial viability:** Which startups have realistic financials vs. which ones need help?
- **Survival depends on it:** Poor financial management is the #1 reason startups fail
- **Competitive advantage:** Entrepreneurs with accounting knowledge succeed more often

**QUICK OVERVIEW:**
üìÖ Thursday, November 7, 2025 | 2:00-6:00 PM
üìç Presentation Hall, ACC Riverside Campus
‚è∞ **IDEA SUBMISSION DEADLINE: October 30, 2025**
üéì FREE for all ACC students
üèÜ Recognition and Awards for Top Pitches
üìä Every pitch includes financial projections

**INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT:**
This event is guided by:
- **Harshal Shah** - Program Director, Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy (harshal.shah@austincc.edu, 512-931-1791)
- **Dr. Andrea Kehoe** - Head of Product, Office of the Future
- **Dr. Monique Reeves** - Executive Director, Office of the Future
- **Monica Sack** - Co-Founder, Gather & Grow Experiences (Former SXSW content developer, 16 years)

**FINANCIAL LITERACY IN ACTION:**

Germaine, your accounting students will see:
- **Realistic vs. unrealistic financial projections** - which entrepreneurs actually understand their numbers?
- **Cash flow mistakes** - many entrepreneurs don't realize they'll run out of money before profitability
- **Business structure decisions** - how LLC vs. S-Corp affects taxes and accounting
- **Investor due diligence** - what financial metrics VCs scrutinize

This is real-world application of classroom concepts - budgeting, financial statements, cash flow analysis, and financial planning.

**Critical Questions:**
