Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Supply, Demand & Market Dynamics in Student Startups

Dear Luke,

I hope this message finds you well! As Economics faculty at ACC, you're teaching students to analyze markets, understand demand signals, and evaluate competitive dynamics. NEST-FEST on November 7th brings these concepts to life through student entrepreneurship.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR ECONOMICS STUDENTS:**

Economics provides the analytical toolkit for entrepreneurial success:

**ECONOMICS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**
- **Demand Analysis:** How entrepreneurs validate customer demand and willingness to pay
- **Supply Chain Economics:** Cost structures, supplier relationships, and production efficiency
- **Market Equilibrium:** Finding the right price point where supply meets demand
- **Elasticity Applications:** How price sensitivity affects revenue and business models
- **Opportunity Cost:** Why entrepreneurs choose to build businesses instead of traditional employment

**The Reality:** Economic analysis separates viable businesses from wishful thinking.
