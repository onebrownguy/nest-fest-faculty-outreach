Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Communication Skills Drive Entrepreneurial Success

Dear Kelly,

I hope this message finds you well! As Communication Studies faculty at ACC, you understand that communication skills are the differentiator between entrepreneurs who succeed and those who don't. NEST-FEST on November 7th demonstrates communication in high-stakes business contexts.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR COMMUNICATION STUDENTS:**

Communication skills determine entrepreneurial outcomes:

**COMMUNICATION IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**
- **Clarity:** Explaining complex ideas simply and memorably
- **Confidence:** Projecting credibility and expertise under pressure
- **Adaptability:** Adjusting messaging for different audiences
- **Authenticity:** Building genuine connections through communication
- **Impact:** Creating memorable presentations that drive action

**The Reality:** Great ideas fail without great communication. Average ideas succeed with exceptional communication.
