Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Economic Principles in Real-World Business Pitches

Dear Alec,

I hope this message finds you well! As Economics faculty at ACC, you're teaching the fundamental principles that drive every business decision - and NEST-FEST on November 7th showcases these economic principles in action through student entrepreneurship.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR ECONOMICS STUDENTS:**

Your students are learning supply and demand, market analysis, competitive advantage, and pricing theory - NEST-FEST demonstrates these concepts in real business contexts:

**ECONOMICS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**
- **Market Analysis:** How entrepreneurs identify underserved markets and demand signals
- **Pricing Strategy:** Cost-plus vs. value-based pricing, price elasticity considerations
- **Competitive Advantage:** How startups compete against established firms (Porter's Five Forces in action)
- **Resource Allocation:** Capital efficiency, opportunity costs, marginal analysis
- **Market Entry Barriers:** What prevents competition and how startups overcome them

**The Reality:** Entrepreneurs who understand economics make better strategic decisions.
