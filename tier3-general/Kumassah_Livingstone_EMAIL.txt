Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Economic Development Through Student Entrepreneurship

Dear Livingstone,

I hope this message finds you well! As Economics faculty at ACC, you understand how entrepreneurship drives economic development and job creation. NEST-FEST on November 7th showcases the next generation of economic contributors through student innovation.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR ECONOMICS STUDENTS:**

Entrepreneurship is where economic theory meets wealth creation:

**ECONOMICS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**
