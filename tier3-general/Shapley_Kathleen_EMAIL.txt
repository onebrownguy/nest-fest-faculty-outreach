Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Persuasive Communication Creates Business Success

Dear Kathleen,

I hope this message finds you well! As Communication Studies faculty at ACC, you're teaching persuasion techniques that entrepreneurs use daily. NEST-FEST on November 7th showcases how persuasive communication converts ideas into funded businesses.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR COMMUNICATION STUDENTS:**

Persuasion isn't just rhetoric - it's how entrepreneurs secure funding, win customers, and recruit talent:

**COMMUNICATION IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**
- **Persuasive Pitches:** Convincing investors to fund businesses
- **Sales Communication:** Persuading customers to buy products/services
- **Influence Strategies:** Building support from partners, employees, advisors
- **Credibility Building:** Establishing trust and expertise
- **Overcoming Objections:** Addressing concerns and resistance

**The Reality:** Entrepreneurs succeed or fail based on their ability to persuade.
