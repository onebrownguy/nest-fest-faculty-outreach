Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Economic Principles Driving Student Entrepreneurship

Dear Felicitas,

I hope this message finds you well! As Economics faculty at ACC, you understand that economic principles aren't just theory - they're the foundation of every business decision. NEST-FEST on November 7th showcases these principles in action through student entrepreneurship pitches.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR ECONOMICS STUDENTS:**

**ECONOMICS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**
