Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Culinary Entrepreneurship & Austin's Food Scene

Dear Chef Sowell,

I hope this message finds you well! Many culinary graduates dream of opening their own restaurant, food truck, or catering company - and NEST-FEST on November 7th shows the business side of that journey.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs. It's the perfect complement to your students' culinary training.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CULINARY STUDENTS:**
