Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Audience Analysis & Message Adaptation in Business

Dear Ladori,

I hope this message finds you well! As Communication Studies faculty at ACC, you know that understanding your audience determines communication success. NEST-FEST on November 7th showcases how entrepreneurs adapt messaging for diverse stakeholders.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR COMMUNICATION STUDENTS:**

Audience analysis is critical in entrepreneurship - same business, different messaging:

**COMMUNICATION IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**
- **Investor Pitches:** Focus on ROI, market opportunity, scalability
- **Customer Messaging:** Emphasize benefits, solutions, value
- **Partner Communication:** Highlight collaboration opportunities, mutual benefit
- **Employee Recruitment:** Culture, mission, growth opportunity
- **Media Relations:** Newsworthy angles, public interest, storytelling

**The Reality:** Entrepreneurs must adapt the same message for different audiences constantly.
