Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Effective Communication Strategies in Entrepreneurship

Dear Lyn,

I hope this message finds you well! As Communication Studies faculty at ACC, you're equipping students with communication strategies that drive professional success. NEST-FEST on November 7th showcases these strategies in entrepreneurial contexts.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR COMMUNICATION STUDENTS:**

Communication strategies separate successful entrepreneurs from unsuccessful ones:

**COMMUNICATION IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**
- **Message Strategy:** What to say and what not to say
- **Timing:** When to communicate and when to listen
- **Channel Selection:** Choosing the right medium for the message
- **Feedback Integration:** Adapting based on audience responses
- **Communication Planning:** Strategic preparation for high-stakes moments

**The Reality:** Strategic communicators outperform better-resourced competitors.
