Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Market Analysis & Competitive Economics in Action

Dear Lei,

I hope this message finds you well! As Economics faculty at ACC, you're teaching the analytical frameworks that drive business strategy. NEST-FEST on November 7th demonstrates how entrepreneurs apply economic analysis to create competitive advantage.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR ECONOMICS STUDENTS:**

Economic analysis isn't just academic - it's how successful businesses make strategic decisions:

**ECONOMICS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**

- **Game Theory Applications:** Strategic decision-making in competitive environments
- **Information Economics:** How asymmetric information creates business opportunities
- **Behavioral Economics:** Understanding consumer psychology and decision-making biases
- **Macroeconomic Factors:** How interest rates, inflation, and economic cycles affect business strategy

**The Reality:** Entrepreneurs with economics training make data-driven strategic decisions.
