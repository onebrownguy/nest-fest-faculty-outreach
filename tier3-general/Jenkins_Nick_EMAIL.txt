Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Economic Principles Meet Real-World Business Strategy

Dear Nick,

I hope this message finds you well! As Economics faculty at ACC, you're equipping students with analytical frameworks that drive business success. NEST-FEST on November 7th demonstrates how economic thinking creates entrepreneurial competitive advantage.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR ECONOMICS STUDENTS:**

Economic literacy is entrepreneurial superpower:

**ECONOMICS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**

**The Reality:** Entrepreneurs who think like economists make better strategic decisions.
