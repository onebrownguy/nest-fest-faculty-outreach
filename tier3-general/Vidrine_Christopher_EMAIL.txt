Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Public Speaking & Presentation Skills in Entrepreneurship

Dear Christopher,

I hope this message finds you well! As Communication Studies faculty at ACC, you know that public speaking skills separate successful entrepreneurs from those with great ideas but poor execution. NEST-FEST on November 7th is a live showcase of presentation skills under pressure.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR COMMUNICATION STUDENTS:**

Public speaking is the #1 entrepreneurial skill:

**COMMUNICATION IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**
- **High-Stakes Presentations:** Pitching to investors, customers, and partners
- **Vocal Delivery:** Pacing, inflection, emphasis, and vocal variety
- **Stage Presence:** Confidence, body language, and commanding attention
- **Anxiety Management:** Performing under pressure with limited preparation time
- **Q&A Skills:** Responding to challenging questions and objections

**The Reality:** Entrepreneurs pitch constantly - fundraising, sales, partnerships, media.
