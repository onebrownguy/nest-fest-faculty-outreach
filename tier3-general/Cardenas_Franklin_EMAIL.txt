Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Food & Event Entrepreneurship in Austin's Vibrant Scene

Dear Professor Cardenas,

I hope this message finds you well! Austin's incredible food scene is built on entrepreneurs who started with food trucks, pop-ups, and catering services - and NEST-FEST on November 7th showcases these entrepreneurial paths for hospitality students.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs. Your students will see how hospitality professionals build their own ventures.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HOSPITALITY STUDENTS:**

- **Food Entrepreneurship:** Food trucks, catering, restaurant concepts
