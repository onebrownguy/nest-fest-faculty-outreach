## üöÄ ACTION PLAN

**Before sending ANY emails:**

1. [ ] Open `tier1-critical` folder
2. [ ] Update all 10 Tier 1 emails with corrections above
3. [ ] Test by sending to yourself first
4. [ ] Verify all links work
5. [ ] Confirm signature looks professional
6. [ ] THEN send to faculty

**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes to update all Tier 1 emails

---

## üí° WHY THESE UPDATES MATTER

**Institutional Credibility:**
- "Office of the Future" + "Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy" = Official ACC initiative
- Harshal Shah (Program Director) = Adult leadership backing students
- Dr. Andrea Kehoe = Faculty supervision and legitimacy
- Monica Sack (SXSW veteran) = Professional mentorship

**Faculty Response:**
Faculty are MORE likely to support when they see:
- Official ACC institutional backing
- Program Director oversight (Harshal Shah)
- Faculty supervision (Dr. Andrea Kehoe)
- Executive leadership support (Dr. Monique Reeves)

This transforms it from "student club event" to "ACC institutional initiative with student leadership."
