Dear Dr. Braxton,

I hope this message finds you well! I'm writing to invite the Business Studies Division to partner with EDGE Team for NEST-FEST 2025 - an entrepreneurship festival and startup pitch competition that aligns with ACC's mission to provide experiential learning opportunities for students.

**SAMPLE DIVISION-WIDE ANNOUNCEMENT:**

"Dear Business Studies Faculty,

I encourage you to inform your students about NEST-FEST, a startup pitch competition hosted by EDGE Team on Thursday, November 7th at ACC Riverside Campus.

This event provides valuable experiential learning opportunities for business students to:
- Observe real-world application of business concepts
- Network with entrepreneurs and industry professionals
- Develop entrepreneurial skills through pitch competition participation
- Explore entrepreneurship career paths

The event is free for all ACC students and aligns with our division's commitment to providing practical, real-world learning experiences.

Please share this opportunity with your classes. Registration: https://nest-fest.org/

Thank you for supporting our students' professional development.

Dr. Lorlie Braxton
Dean, Business Studies Division"

**FACULTY SUPPORT MATERIALS:**

We can provide:
- Digital flyers for Canvas announcements
- 60-second class announcement scripts
- Optional extra credit frameworks for faculty who want to integrate NEST-FEST into coursework
- Post-event reflection paper prompts for business students

**INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT:**

With 5,000 business students across ACC, even 5-10% attendance would mean 250-500 students experiencing entrepreneurship education outside the classroom. This positions ACC as a leader in entrepreneurship education among Texas community colleges.

**VIP RECEPTION INVITATION:**

Dr. Braxton, we would be honored to host you at a VIP reception during NEST-FEST to:
- Meet student entrepreneurs competing in pitch competition
- Connect with local business leaders and startup founders
- Discuss future collaboration between EDGE Team and Business Studies Division
- Celebrate ACC's role in fostering entrepreneurship education

Would you be available for a brief call to discuss how NEST-FEST can best support the Business Studies Division and your 5,000 students?

Thank you for your leadership in advancing business education at ACC. We look forward to partnering with you to create meaningful opportunities for students.
