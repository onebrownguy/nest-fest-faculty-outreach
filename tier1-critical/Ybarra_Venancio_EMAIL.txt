Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Austin Tech Startup Ecosystem Opportunity for CS/IT Students

Dear Dean Ybarra,

I hope this message finds you well! I'm writing to invite the Computer Science and Information Technology Division to partner with EDGE Team for NEST-FEST 2025 - an entrepreneurship festival that showcases Austin's thriving tech startup ecosystem to ACC students.

As Dean overseeing CS, IT, Cybersecurity, and Software Development programs, you know that many ACC graduates go on to start tech companies, join startups, or build their own software products. NEST-FEST provides a window into that entrepreneurial journey.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CS/IT STUDENTS:**

Your students are learning to code, develop software, secure systems, and build applications. NEST-FEST shows them how those technical skills translate into entrepreneurial opportunities:

- **Software Development:** See SaaS products, mobile apps, and web platforms pitched by student entrepreneurs
- **Cybersecurity:** Learn how security startups identify market needs and monetize security solutions
- **Web Development:** Understand how developers turn side projects into viable businesses
- **IT Infrastructure:** Discover how tech consultancies and managed services companies get started

**AUSTIN'S TECH STARTUP ECOSYSTEM:**

Austin is one of the fastest-growing tech hubs in the U.S.:
- Oracle, Tesla, Apple, Google all have major presences here
- Hundreds of startups launched by UT and ACC graduates
- Venture capital funding flowing into Austin tech companies
- Growing demand for technical talent in startup environment

NEST-FEST connects ACC tech students with this ecosystem they're about to enter.
