Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Real-World Event Management & Hospitality Entrepreneurship

Dear Professor Hundley,

I hope this message finds you well! As Department Chair for Hospitality Management and Meeting & Event Planning, I'm reaching out about an opportunity that perfectly aligns with your students' professional development - both as event management observation and as an introduction to hospitality entrepreneurship.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HOSPITALITY & EVENT PLANNING STUDENTS:**

Your students are learning to plan events, manage hospitality operations, and deliver exceptional guest experiences. NEST-FEST offers two distinct learning opportunities:

**1. EVENT MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE:**
- Observe a professionally-run event from concept to execution
- See event logistics, attendee experience design, and program flow in action
- Study how to create engaging programming for diverse audiences
- Learn from real-world event planning decisions and problem-solving

**2. ENTREPRENEURSHIP PERSPECTIVE:**
- Austin's food scene is built on entrepreneurs who started with food trucks and pop-ups
- Event planning is increasingly an entrepreneurial field (many start their own firms)
- Catering businesses, restaurant concepts, and hospitality services often begin as student ideas
- Your students could become the entrepreneurs pitching at future NEST-FESTs

- **Dr. Monique Reeves** - Executive Director, Office of the Future
- **Monica Sack** - Co-Founder, Gather & Grow Experiences (Former SXSW content developer, 16 years)

**HOSPITALITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN AUSTIN:**

Austin's vibrant food and hospitality scene started with entrepreneurs:
- Food trucks that became brick-and-mortar restaurants
- Catering companies started by culinary school graduates
- Event planning firms founded by hospitality professionals
- Unique venue concepts (food halls, pop-up dining experiences)

NEST-FEST will feature entrepreneurs in these spaces, showing your students the path from hospitality education to business ownership.
