Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Division-Wide Entrepreneurship Opportunity for Business Students

Dear Professor Midkiff,

I hope this message finds you well! As Department Chair overseeing Marketing, Fashion Marketing, Real Estate & Finance - and with your leadership role on the Fashion Incubator Advisory Board - I wanted to reach out about a significant entrepreneurship opportunity for ACC business students.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOUR BUSINESS STUDENTS:**

Your students are learning marketing strategies, financial planning, real estate investment, and business fundamentals in textbooks. NEST-FEST shows them these concepts in action through real startup pitches, business plans, and entrepreneurial decision-making.
