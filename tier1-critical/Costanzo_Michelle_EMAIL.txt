Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Hospitality Entrepreneurship & Faculty Network Opportunity

Dear Michelle,

I hope this message finds you well! As an Adjunct Professor in Hospitality and Associate Dean of Faculty Recruitment, you have a unique dual perspective - both industry expertise and broad faculty connections across ACC. I'm reaching out because NEST-FEST offers value on both fronts.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HOSPITALITY STUDENTS:**

Your hospitality students are training to work in restaurants, hotels, catering, and event planning - but many don't realize these skills also lead to business ownership:

- **Food Entrepreneurship:** Food trucks, catering companies, restaurant concepts (Austin's food scene is built on this)
- **Event Planning Businesses:** Many graduates start their own event planning firms rather than working for venues
- **Hospitality Services:** Unique concepts like pop-up dining, private chef services, specialty catering
- **Venue Concepts:** Creative hospitality spaces (food halls, event venues, unique dining experiences)

NEST-FEST showcases these entrepreneurial paths, showing hospitality students they can be business owners, not just employees.
