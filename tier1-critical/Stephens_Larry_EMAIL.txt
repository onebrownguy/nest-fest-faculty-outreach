Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Financial Literacy Foundation for Every Entrepreneur

Dear Dr. Stephens,

I hope this message finds you well! As Department Chair for Accounting with your CPA and JD/LLM credentials, you understand better than anyone that every successful entrepreneur needs financial literacy. NEST-FEST on November 7th showcases exactly why accounting is the foundation of business success.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs. It's a live demonstration of why accounting skills are non-negotiable for business ownership.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR ACCOUNTING STUDENTS:**

Your students are learning debits, credits, financial statements, and tax planning - sometimes wondering how this applies beyond traditional accounting careers. NEST-FEST answers that question:

**ACCOUNTING IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**
- **Every pitch includes financials:** Revenue projections, expense budgets, cash flow management
- **Unit economics matter:** Cost per customer, profit margins, break-even analysis
- **Tax implications:** How business structure (LLC, S-Corp, etc.) affects taxes (your JD/LLM expertise!)
- **Investor due diligence:** VCs and investors scrutinize financial statements and accounting practices
- **Survival depends on it:** Most startups fail due to poor financial management, not bad ideas

**The Reality:** Entrepreneurs with accounting knowledge have a massive competitive advantage.

**QUICK OVERVIEW:**
üìÖ Thursday, November 7, 2025 | 2:00-6:00 PM
üìç Presentation Hall, ACC Riverside Campus
üéì FREE for all ACC students
üèÜ Recognition and Awards for Top Pitches
üìä Every pitch includes financial projections


**INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT:**
This event is guided by:
- **Harshal Shah** - Program Director, Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy (harshal.shah@austincc.edu, 512-931-1791)
- **Dr. Andrea Kehoe** - Head of Product, Office of the Future
- **Dr. Monique Reeves** - Executive Director, Office of the Future
- **Monica Sack** - Co-Founder, Gather & Grow Experiences (Former SXSW content developer, 16 years)

**FINANCIAL LITERACY GAPS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:**

You've likely seen this in your practice and teaching:
- Entrepreneurs who don't understand cash flow management
- Business owners who can't read their own financial statements
- Startups that overspend because they don't budget properly
- Companies that fail tax compliance due to accounting ignorance

**NEST-FEST highlights these challenges** - your students will see which pitches have solid financials vs. which ones need accounting help.
