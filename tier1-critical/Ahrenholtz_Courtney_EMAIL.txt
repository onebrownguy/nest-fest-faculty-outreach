Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - Real-World Marketing & Finance for Student Entrepreneurs

Dear Professor Ahrenholtz,

I hope this message finds you well! As a Professor of Marketing and Finance at ACC, you teach two disciplines that are absolutely essential for every entrepreneur - and NEST-FEST on November 7th brings both to life in real-world pitch presentations.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs. It's everything you teach in class, but in action.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR MARKETING & FINANCE STUDENTS:**

Your students learn about customer segmentation, branding, social media marketing, financial modeling, and fundraising in textbooks. NEST-FEST shows them how entrepreneurs actually use these tools:

**MARKETING IN ACTION:**
- How startups identify target customers and craft messaging
- Social media strategies with zero budget
- Brand positioning for new ventures competing in crowded markets
- Customer acquisition tactics for products nobody's heard of yet
- Storytelling that turns features into benefits

**FINANCE IN ACTION:**
- Revenue projections and unit economics for early-stage ventures
- How entrepreneurs value their companies when pitching investors
- Burn rate, runway, and cash flow management for startups
- Funding strategy: bootstrapping vs. equity vs. debt
- ROI calculations for marketing spend and customer acquisition

**QUICK OVERVIEW:**
üìÖ Thursday, November 7, 2025 | 2:00-6:00 PM
üìç Presentation Hall, ACC Riverside Campus
üéì FREE for all ACC students
üèÜ Recognition and Awards for Top Pitches

- Go-to-market strategy (marketing channels and tactics)
