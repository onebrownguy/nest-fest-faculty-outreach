Subject: NEST-FEST Nov 7 - External Partnership Opportunity with EDGE Team

Dear Rene,

I hope this message finds you well! As Assistant Dean of Distance Education & External Partnerships, I wanted to reach out about a partnership opportunity between EDGE Team and ACC's Computer Science & IT Division.

NEST-FEST is a student-led entrepreneurship pitch event supported by Austin Community College's Office of the Future under the newly formed Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy. Led by Program Director Harshal Shah and Faculty Supervisor Dr. Andrea Kehoe, this event brings together innovative ideas from ACC students with mentorship and recognition to drive the next wave of student entrepreneurs. Given your role in external partnerships, I believe this aligns with ACC's broader strategy to create industry connections for students.

**WHY THIS PARTNERSHIP MATTERS:**

NEST-FEST creates a bridge between ACC students and Austin's entrepreneurship community:

1. **Industry Connections:** Local entrepreneurs, startup founders, and business professionals attend as judges and mentors
2. **Student Success:** Experiential learning opportunities beyond traditional classroom settings
3. **Community Engagement:** Positions ACC as a hub for entrepreneurship education in Austin
4. **Career Pathways:** Exposes students to alternative career paths in startups and entrepreneurship
5. **External Visibility:** Showcases ACC students' innovation and business thinking to broader Austin community

**QUICK OVERVIEW:**
üìÖ Thursday, November 7, 2025 | 2:00-6:00 PM
üìç Presentation Hall, ACC Riverside Campus
‚è∞ **IDEA SUBMISSION DEADLINE: October 30, 2025**

**INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT:**
This event is guided by:
- **Harshal Shah** - Program Director, Entrepreneurship & Innovation Academy (harshal.shah@austincc.edu, 512-931-1791)
- **Dr. Andrea Kehoe** - Head of Product, Office of the Future
- **Dr. Monique Reeves** - Executive Director, Office of the Future
- **Monica Sack** - Co-Founder, Gather & Grow Experiences (Former SXSW content developer, 16 years)

**EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES:**

This event creates multiple partnership touchpoints:

**For ACC:**
- Strengthen relationship with EDGE Team (student-led entrepreneurship organization)
- Connect students with Austin startup ecosystem and business community
- Create ongoing entrepreneurship programming beyond one-time event
- Position ACC as entrepreneurship education leader among Texas community colleges

**For CS/IT Students Specifically:**
- Many tech students don't realize entrepreneurship is accessible until they see peers doing it
- Austin's tech scene offers tremendous opportunities for ACC graduates
- Software development, cybersecurity, and IT skills are foundation for many startups
- Distance education students can attend virtually or in person

**For Distance Education:**
- Potential to live-stream NEST-FEST for remote students
- Create online entrepreneurship programming inspired by event success
- Engage distance learners in experiential learning opportunities
- Build virtual community around entrepreneurship education

**PARTNERSHIP REQUEST:**

Rene, given your focus on external partnerships and distance education innovation, would you be willing to:

1. **Internal Advocacy:** Champion NEST-FEST within CS/IT leadership as a valuable external partnership
2. **Faculty Outreach:** Help us connect with CS/IT faculty to promote event to students
3. **Distance Education:** Explore opportunities to extend NEST-FEST's reach to online students
4. **Future Collaboration:** Discuss how EDGE Team can support ACC's external partnership goals beyond this event

**EASY FACULTY ANNOUNCEMENT (For CS/IT Faculty):**

"EDGE Team, an ACC student organization, is hosting NEST-FEST on November 7th - a startup pitch competition that showcases tech entrepreneurship and connects students with Austin's startup ecosystem. Encourage your students to attend, especially those interested in software development, tech startups, or entrepreneurship. Free event with awards and recognition.

**INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT:**

ACC has a unique opportunity to differentiate itself through entrepreneurship education:
- Community colleges traditionally focus on job placement
- ACC can also position itself as launching pad for student entrepreneurs
- NEST-FEST demonstrates ACC students' innovation and business thinking
- Partnership with EDGE Team creates ongoing programming, not just one event

**EXTERNAL VISIBILITY:**

NEST-FEST will:
- Feature ACC students pitching businesses to community judges
- Bring local entrepreneurs and business leaders to ACC campus
- Generate media coverage highlighting ACC's role in Austin's startup ecosystem
- Create social media content showcasing student innovation

This positions ACC as more than a traditional community college - it's an entrepreneurship hub.

**DISTANCE EDUCATION INNOVATION:**

Given your distance education role, there may be opportunities to:
- Live-stream pitch competition for remote students
- Create online entrepreneurship courses inspired by NEST-FEST model
- Build virtual mentorship program connecting students with entrepreneurs
- Develop hybrid event models for future NEST-FESTs

**VIP RECEPTION INVITATION:**

Rene, we would be honored to host you at a VIP reception during NEST-FEST to:
- Meet student entrepreneurs and pitch competitors
- Connect with local business leaders and startup founders
- Discuss future partnership opportunities between EDGE Team and ACC
- Explore how this event model can scale across ACC divisions
